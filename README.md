## 👋 About Me

I design and build **production-ready backend systems** and **LLM-powered assistants**. My focus is moving teams toward **faster and more reliable delivery** through solid architecture, a strong data layer, measurable quality metrics, and lean processes.

## 🧭 What I Do

* **Architecture & Leadership:** Design domain-driven, scalable **backend architectures**; lead roadmap, prioritization, and technical decision-making.
* **LLM/RAG Productization:** Build **RAG assistants** with private knowledge bases; ensure index quality, retrieval robustness, and traceable answer quality.
* **Data Layer & Search:** Set up PostgreSQL/pgvector, **Qdrant**, and hybrid search (BM25 + embeddings); handle schema design, performance, and security together.
* **API Design & Performance:** Ship clean APIs with **FastAPI/Java**; caching, pagination, rate limiting, idempotency, and **observability** (metrics, logs, traces).
* **DevOps & Reliability:** Docker/Compose, CI/CD, health checks, rollback strategies, backups; production quality with an **SLO/SLI** mindset.
* **Security & Access:** Authentication, RBAC, secrets management, data masking/PII; environment isolation (dev/stage/prod) and **least privilege**.
* **DX (Developer Experience):** Repo structure, code standards, test pyramid, templates (issue/PR), **automated quality gates**, and documentation.
* **Mentoring:** Code reviews, 1:1 growth plans, and hands-on team workshops.

## 📌 Areas Where I Drive Progress

* **RAG Quality:** Evaluation pipelines for retrieval and answer quality; constraints and prompting techniques to reduce hallucinations.
* **Standardization:** API contracts, error schemas, logging formats, and **layered architecture** to create a shared language across the team.
* **Performance & Scale:** Reduce N+1 and unnecessary I/O, query optimization, caching, and asynchronous processing.
* **Observability:** App metrics, request tracing, and alert thresholds for **fast diagnosis** and **low MTTR**.
* **CI/CD & Versioning:** Multi-stage pipelines, automated tests, semantic versioning, and safe release/rollback practices.
* **Data Quality:** ETL/ELT workflows, schema evolution, validation, and **auditable** data pipelines.
* **Cost & Simplicity:** Technology choices that minimize unnecessary complexity and optimize resource usage.
* **Documentation & Playbooks:** “Docs as code,” incident flows, and actionable runbooks.

## 🧰 Tech Snapshot

</p>

Also: Qdrant, pgvector, ChromaDB, Hugging Face, scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM, CatBoost, RAPIDS (cuDF/cuML), Dask, Streamlit, Nginx.

## 🔭 Current Focus

* **RAG Evaluation:** Datasets, local/remote embedding models, **retrieval quality metrics**, and automated reporting.
* **Multi-Tenant Architecture:** Row-level access, safe isolation, and configuration management.
* **Performance:** Async patterns in Python (FastAPI), concurrency and profiling-driven improvements in Java.
* **GPU Acceleration:** RAPIDS/Dask experiments in data pipelines.
* **Security:** Secrets management, dependency scanning, and software supply chain security.

## 🧠 Working Principles

* **You can’t manage what you don’t measure:** Goals, metrics, telemetry.
* **Simplicity first:** Get the architecture right, then optimize.
* **Small PRs, frequent delivery:** Build, observe, iterate.
* **Blameless culture:** Learn from incidents; strengthen processes.
* **Comprehensive testing:** Unit + integration + end-to-end.
